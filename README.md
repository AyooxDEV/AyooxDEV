🎯 Profile
Hands on Security Operations and SIEM Analyst with strong experience in SOC monitoring, Splunk SIEM engineering, cloud log analysis, and security visibility workflows. I specialize in building dashboards, creating alerts, and analyzing large volumes of log data to help teams understand what happens inside their systems in real time.

My work focuses on Splunk search development, dashboard creation, real time alerting, correlation logic, and log ingestion pipelines. I translate raw security logs into clear insights that support detection, investigation, and response. I understand how security events behave across cloud environments and design structured monitoring workflows to improve detection quality and reduce noise.

Alongside traditional SOC analytics, I am expanding into machine learning for security use cases. I apply data driven techniques to anomaly detection, log scoring, and smarter alerting patterns.
